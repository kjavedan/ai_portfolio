## What I Bring to the Table

- I never complain, make excuses, or give up.
- I have **3+ years of startup experience**, which means I know how to cut the bullshit out and focus on what matters most.
- I take ownership of work and save you time making the harder decisions.
- I never blame someone else for my mistakes and take full responsibility.
- I have **solo designed, developed, and deployed a fullstack web app** which proves my flexibility to wear different hats and build an entire product: [chikrice.khaled-javdan.com](https://chikrice.khaled-javdan.com/), [github](https://github.com/orgs/chikrice/repositories)
- I do **Designing, Backend, and DevOps** if needed; however, **Frontend** is my strongest skill.
- I prefer working with a team rather than aloneâ€”this way we can build something remarkable.
- I am very efficient at building **PWAs (progressive web apps)**, which is perfect for early-stage startups.

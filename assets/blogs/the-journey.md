# The journey?

My name is **Khaled Javdan**, and I‚Äôm a 27-year-old **Software Engineer** specializing in **Frontend Development**.  
Originally from **Iran**, I pursued my goal of building a career in software by moving to **Dubai** after college, where my journey began.

---

### 2017: First Year - College Freshman

I started my software engineering journey in October 2017. From the first day, I was fascinated by the world of technology and eager to learn more. I was honored to be recognized as the **Top Student of the Year**, which fueled my passion and motivated me to work even harder throughout college.

---

### 2018: Second Year - Finding My Way

The second year was all about exploration. I was coding a lot but honestly didn‚Äôt fully understand what I was building yet. It took time for me to get comfortable with the programming world and start seeing how everything connected.

---

### 2019: Third Year - Deepening My Knowledge

This year things got serious. I started learning about **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**, and had a lot of "aha" moments. After this, I was excited to start building my own projects.

---

### üéì 2020: Graduation Year

In my final year, we tackled advanced topics such as **software development methods**, **testing**, and why structured processes matter as projects grow. I built my first full-stack e-commerce site using **HTML**, **CSS**, **PHP**, and **MySQL** ‚Äî featuring authentication, product pages, a cart, and user profiles. It wasn't fancy, but I was proud of it.

---

### 2021: Building Foundations Post-Graduation

After graduating, I focused on improving my **English** skills and deepening my knowledge of **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**. During this time, I built various projects using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Vanilla JavaScript**, and **React**.

### 2022: First Job in Dubai - CEIT Web Game Startup

I moved to Dubai and joined **CEIT**, a web game startup. This was a huge leap ‚Äî I had no prior game development experience. I quickly adapted, working with technologies like **HTML Canvas**, **Three.js**, **Pixi.js**, **React**, **Styled Components**, **MUI**, **SCSS**, and more. I built admin dashboards, authentication systems, payment gateways, and worked closely with **Postman**, **Swagger**, and **Figma**.

Unfortunately, after a year, the company couldn't sustain operations. However, I helped deliver:

- 4 small web games
- 1 web app (a hub integrating the games, payments, user accounts, and admin dashboard)

I was the sole **Frontend Developer** on a team of 5, building all frontend components.

During this time, I also built an interactive portfolio using **React**, **Next.js**, **HTML Canvas**, **Three.js**, and **Sound Effects**.

### 2023: Growing with Utopia - Digital Marketing Agency

In 2023, I joined **Utopia**, a digital marketing agency startup. Here, I transitioned from **React** to **Vue.js**. Early on, I was tasked with integrating a **24/7 livestream feature** for the main website using **Agora SDK**. Later, we switched to **Tencent Cloud** to optimize costs.

After the success of this project, I was promoted to **Lead Frontend Engineer** where I:

- Integrated **real-time communication** with WebSockets.
- Helped the platform grow to over **100K visitors**.
- Built a custom **CMS dashboard** for Admins.
- Set up a **CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions, cutting deployment time by 40%.
- Took initiative managing production environments (Linux, Nginx, Redis, MySQL, AWS EC2, S3, Cloudflare).
- Developed modern, SEO-optimized web pages for company clients using Next.js, improving site performance and visual appeal.
- Built a reusable component library to speed up development and maintain a consistent design system across projects.
- Refactored and rewrote the existing codebase for better maintainability, readability, and scalability.
- Expanded into backend development by learning MongoDB, Mongoose, Node.js, Express, and RESTful APIs.
- Designed and developed a custom e-commerce website from scratch, including:
  A fully functional admin dashboard with a highly customized clean UI.
- Secure user authentication, product management, and order management features.
- Applied best practices in frontend and backend architecture, improving project quality and development efficiency.
- Project Showcase: [**View My E-commerce Website**](https://shop.khaled-javdan.com/)
  This project was built from scratch using React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and a fully customized Material-UI (MUI) design system. It also incorporates Progressive Web App (PWA) features, SWR for data fetching, i18next for internationalization, react-map-gl for interactive maps, Yup and Zod for validation, React Hook Form for form handling, and Framer Motion for animations.
  Throughout this project, I also deepened my knowledge of design systems, application architecture, and full-stack development workflows.

Our tech stack included **Vue 2 & 3**, **Vuex**, **Pinia**, **TailwindCSS**, **UnoCSS**, **SCSS**, **Element UI**, **Vuetify**, and tools like **ESLint**, **Prettier**, **Vite**, and **Vitest**.

In my free time, I built [**Chikrice**](https://chikrice.netlify.app/#/), a smart meal planner powered by Vue 3, Pinia, Vite, TypeScript, UnoCSS and Element Plus.

The motivation behind this project came from a recurring challenge‚Äîmany of my friends would often ask for my help with dieting. Since I have a decent amount of experience with fitness and nutrition, I‚Äôd get questions like:
‚ÄúWhat should I eat? How much? When? How many calories should I consume? How long will it take to reach my goal?‚Äù
At first, I used to write meal plans by hand, but it was time-consuming and hard to maintain. That‚Äôs when Chikrice was born.

Originally, I started building this idea back in June 2022 under the name [**IronBrothers**](https://ironbrothers.netlify.app/), when I had just begun learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Naturally, my skills were still growing, so the project didn‚Äôt turn out as I envisioned.

Two years later, after gaining hands-on experience through professional projects and sharpening my skills, I revisited the idea and built [**Chikrice**](https://chikrice.netlify.app/#/), v2‚Äîthis time with a more modern tech stack and a better understanding of UI/UX. I deliberately skipped building a backend to keep development lean and to validate the idea first (inspired by the principles from The Lean Startup). Surprisingly, some of my friends started using it regularly, which gave me the confidence to take it even further.

This brings me to my upcoming chapter‚ÄîChikrice v3 in 2024‚Äîwhere I plan to rebuild the app as a full-fledged SaaS platform with a complete backend, AI integration, and a richer feature set.

### 2024: Freelancing, Building Chikrice v3, and Running a Business

2024 was the craziest and most challenging year of my life.

It was in May 2024 when **Utopia** closed its doors. I kind of saw it coming, even though I gave it my all‚Äîfighting with everything I had to deliver high-quality projects and help the company survive its first year.

In the startup world, the first year is always the hardest: you have no customers, and you're building a product that demands great marketing, strong networking, and a sharp focus on solving a real problem with minimal costs and friction.

If you asked me why both startups I worked for failed to survive past their first year, I'd say‚Äîbased on experience‚Äîit was likely a mix of the following:

1. No market need (the most common one)
2. Ran out of cash
3. Not the right team
4. Poor marketing or positioning
5. Ignoring customer feedback
6. A product without a clear vision

I reflect on these experiences often. You pour your heart into a product, working day and night with your team to make it succeed‚Äîand then boom, a hard slap from reality. It hurts, deeply. I was tired of building products that would never see the light of day.

After Utopia shut down, I had had enough of following leaders who didn‚Äôt know what they were doing. I had the technical skills to build a real solution for diet and nutrition, something I could monetize, without going through the soul-crushing job search again‚Äîonly to end up in another company where I'd give it my all, just to watch it fail.

I wanted control over my future. Enough was enough.

I had a stack of wins on my resume and sky-high confidence. My plan was simple: cover my expenses through freelancing and use the rest of my time to build **Chikrice**. I took all my savings from two years of work and made a bold move.

After two years in Dubai, I learned something important: office snacks, fancy dinners, and cool interior design are just unnecessary expenses. If we had invested everything in the product, we might have won. So that‚Äôs what I did.

I found the most affordable apartment in **Khorfakkan, Sharjah**, and I loved it. It had everything I needed: no people, no distractions, no family, no friends‚Äîjust tunnel vision. I created the perfect environment, invested in productivity tools, and went all in.

This was the riskiest and biggest decision of my life. I was betting everything I had earned through relentless hard work‚Äîon myself. I felt a deep sense of pride. Finally, I was the master of my fate, the captain of my soul.

Motivation? Off the charts. The fire was real‚Äîyou could feel it just by being near me.

This was my moment. Time to build the next big thing. Time to prove everyone wrong. Time to succeed so loudly that no one could ever doubt me again.

---

**Day 1:** I set up my Upwork profile, listed my projects, filled out every section, and started applying to gigs. I spent the entire day, from morning till night, submitting proposals‚Äîspending $5‚Äì$10 per day.

One month passed.

Guess what?

**Not a single client.**

Chikrice was on hold, and my precious savings were being drained by Upwork with zero results. I wasn‚Äôt happy. I changed my strategy a few times, but still no progress.

Still, my confidence remained high. I felt everything was under control‚Äîuntil life hit hard.

My mother was diagnosed with a serious eye condition and needed urgent surgery or she would lose her sight. I traveled to **Iran** to be by her side.

Even there, I continued applying to jobs on Upwork. After 20 days of persistence‚Äî**finally!** I got an interview.

**Let‚Äôs gooooooooooo.**

It was exactly what I had dreamed of:  
$45/hour, working with modern tools like Next.js, ShadCN, Prisma, tRPC, and React Query. It felt perfect.

The interview went great, and I was confident the job was mine.

As my mother‚Äôs condition improved and my hopes were high, I booked a ticket back to Khorfakkan to get to work.

I sat in my chair, opened Upwork, and read the message from Michel:

> "Hi! Just wanted to let you know we are pausing our hiring process. We found a candidate we want to proceed with. If that doesn't work out, or anything changes I will let you know."

It was a hard slap to the ego. After two months and over $100 spent, still no client.

**Time for a new plan.**

I had 10 months left. Chikrice was calling.

So I went all in‚Äî16 hours a day.

I built [**Chikrice v2**](https://chikrice.netlify.app/#/), ready to show users. I talked to gym owners, restaurant owners, coaches, athletes‚Äîgathering feedback. Some days I was on fire, others I was crushed by rejection.

But at least this time, I had control. No boss. No freelance job that didn‚Äôt value my skills.

Most people liked the idea. They especially liked that it would be **free**.

I took all my experience and skills and designed the **Figma prototype** for Chikrice v2:  
[**Figma v2**](https://www.figma.com/design/oZpHX4OIz0y1xgRs9seugp/ChikRice?node-id=3-1500&t=Xzy9tPNXwOIq36l1-1)

It was simple‚Äîbut ugly. I didn‚Äôt want my work to be known for mediocrity.

So I redesigned it.

And created [**Chikrice v3**](https://www.figma.com/design/GhO8YrBUHKPgnjSwTmCfiy/chikrice_3?node-id=0-1&t=WwqwEkjiA3B0d8L4-1).

Looking back now, I see my mistake‚ÄîI spent too much time polishing things that weren‚Äôt the most important. That better design? It was mostly to satisfy my ego.

But hey, that‚Äôs part of the journey.

# Mistake of Spreading Too Thin ‚Äì What I Learned

Given my situation‚Äîwith no manpower, limited resources, and limited time‚ÄîI **should have spent most of my time developing the core feature**. In my opinion, that feature was a **simple dashboard for coaches to generate meal plans for their clients**.

This way, I would have developed something useful and potentially monetizable, instead of building fancy features just to **show off my technical skills and design abilities**.

It‚Äôs painful to point out your own mistakes, but that‚Äôs how we learn.

---

## Chikrice v3 ‚Äì The All-Over-the-Place Version

As I was designing **Chikrice v3**, I kept coming up with new ideas and features. And honestly, they **felt really good**. But the problem was clear:

> I was spreading my focus and attention way too thin.

I was trying to build features for three different user types:

- A healthy restaurant
- A coach
- An athlete

I‚Äôd jump from one idea to another: one day working on coach-related features, the next on the athlete‚Äôs needs.

### The Result?

To support all this, I had to:

- Talk with athletes
- Build features based on their feedback
- Engage in conversations, brainstorm, design, develop (frontend/backend), test, and deploy on servers

That‚Äôs **a lot** for one person to handle, especially when your focus is split in multiple directions.

The consequences:

- The **quality of work** dropped across the board
- The **chance of bugs and issues** increased
- The **quality of code** decreased, even with best practices
- The **stress and anxiety** increased due to time and money running out

After 6 months of back-and-forth, [**Chikrice v3**](https://chikrice.khaled-javdan.com/) was ready for users.

I had **around 30 users**, but most didn‚Äôt use it for long. Once dieting was over, **they didn‚Äôt need the app anymore**, and I couldn‚Äôt force them to use it.

I was **exhausted**, like a soldier returning from war.

---

## The Next 4 Months: Plan B

At this point, I couldn‚Äôt monetize Chikrice‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt even satisfied enough with it to ask friends for money for something they weren‚Äôt using regularly.

I had:

- No money left
- No time left
- No motivation

It felt like I had lost all my weapons and soldiers in battle‚Äîbut I still wasn‚Äôt ready to give up.

So I came up with a new plan:

> **Make some money to reinvest in the app and get help from other engineers.**

---

## Birth of EYB (Elevate Your Brand)

Upwork didn‚Äôt seem promising anymore.  
That‚Äôs when [**EYB**](https://services.khaled-javdan.com/) came to mind‚Äîa web agency idea.

> I could build landing pages and e-commerce websites for small business owners and use the profit to fund Chikrice.

But how?

I was living in **Khorfakkan**, a small city of 40,000 people, with little economic activity. Still, I went store to store, asking if they needed a website.

### Lots of rejection.

Eventually, I got a project through my old network in **Dubai**:  
An e-commerce project for [**Aiyifen**](https://aiyifen.com).

### Why Shopify?

Even though I had no Shopify experience, I chose it over custom development to avoid satisfying my technical ego.  
I had no time to build everything from scratch again.

I had issues setting up Stripe and editing Shopify themes, but the project was delivered successfully‚Äîand I was very happy about it.

---

## Team Formation Begins

The owner of Aiyifen asked for help with **marketing**.

I saw an opportunity:

> Form a team and offer marketing + web development services.

I didn‚Äôt know marketing. So I read about it, but I knew I couldn‚Äôt risk people‚Äôs money.  
So I reached out to:

- **Faiz** ‚Äì a digital marketer
- **Sajad** ‚Äì a content creator

We decided to take a risk and **offer our services on a profit-share model**:

> We take **5% of profits only** ‚Äî so the client had nothing to lose.

### Month 1:

- 10,000 website visitors
- 4000 AED budget
- 31 purchases
- 6000 AED in sales
- 0 AED in profit ‚Üí we made 0

### Month 2:

- 3500 AED budget
- 52 purchases
- 8000 AED in sales
- 2400 AED profit ‚Üí 5% = 120 AED ‚Üí 40 AED each üòÖ

This wasn‚Äôt enough to reinvest in Chikrice or motivate the team.

---

## Final Month & Pausing EYB

We told the client we‚Äôd support for **one more month**.  
Then we helped transition marketing responsibilities back to the Aiyifen team.

I knew this wasn‚Äôt a short-term strategy.  
To keep the team motivated, **we needed real income**.

So we paused EYB to rethink our direction.

---

## The Final Month

With 1 month left, I didn‚Äôt have time to grieve.

I had to **figure something out**, so I went back to the **job market** to earn and regroup financially.

---

# Reflections After 12 Months

After 12 months:

- I didn‚Äôt achieve the goal of making **Chikrice successful**
- It hurts ‚Äî a lot
- One year of ruthless grind, loneliness, and no income

But‚Ä¶

> I **learned more than I could‚Äôve imagined**.

I have nothing to show for it except a **story and scars**. But I‚Äôve made peace with that. Unlike my past attempts, this one didn‚Äôt get me what I wanted, but it gave me something deeper ‚Äî growth. It was, without a doubt, the **hardest chapter of my life so far**.

## What I Want Now

At this point, I don‚Äôt want to go through it all again, alone. I want to **help someone else** who‚Äôs on a mission. I want to **give my full energy, experience, and skills** to a meaningful project or team.

In return, I hope for:

- **Mentorship**
- **Learning**
- A **team** that brings out the best in me

## Addressing Concerns

I know I might seem like a risky hire. Some might think I‚Äôm not loyal or that I‚Äôm too independent.

But here‚Äôs the truth:

> I **give everything** when I believe in the leader and the mission.

I‚Äôve experienced this before ‚Äî it was the **best period of my career**. When I trust the vision, I can fully focus on the work and give it my all.

## What I Bring

- Drive
- Dedication
- Discipline
- Experience in startups, solo projects, and product building
- A raw, real hunger to **make something meaningful**

---

This was my story so far ‚Äî shared with honesty, no mask, no filters.  
I know there‚Äôs a **team or mission** out there where I fit perfectly in this next chapter.

And I would be **honored** to be part of that team ‚Äî and help **make a difference**.
